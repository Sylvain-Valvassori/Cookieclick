## Description
The game was created based on [Coockie Clicker](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker) in which we must click on the target until we have as many points as possible to buy bonus and thus generate more clicks "points", this version was used as theme of [Halloween](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween) . as a way of celebrating this time of year!

* The game has a responsive design for all screen types
* It has a beautiful design with 3D animation
* Functional buttons with beautiful animations 

## How it was developed

The game was thought together by all collaborators, and was developed based on HTML with JavaScript to make it fully functional and playable, and the appearance was made in CSS/SCSS. 
We also used resources such as reference links, public images that were adapted and edited in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe XD to develop the model that served as the basis
